title: Configure Bitcoin Node
---

Think of your bitcoin node as a fake bitcoin detector, it will confirm that bitcoin's consensus rules are being followed so that when you receive a payment you can validate that you are getting real bitcoins.
It will also help with fee estimation, coin selection, and generating transactions.

Keep in mind that while a malicious full node can try to deceive you, it does not have access to your private keys.

You can install Specter-Desktop on your home computer alongside Bitcoin Core. 
Alternatively, you can use a product to setup your Bitcoin Core Node, such as [RaspiBlitz](https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/), [Nodl](https://www.nodl.it/), and [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) (Premium edition).
They all come with Specter-Desktop packaged, but only RaspiBlitz is free (Nodl and myNode Premium are paid products).

[TODO]: find 1-click cloud deploy node?

#### Required Configuration
In order for [Specter-Desktop](/install-specter) to connect to this full node, you'll need to configure some settings in your `bitcoin.conf` file.
You can do this by going to the directory where Bitcoin is installed, and opening the bitcoin.conf file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad).
Insert the following 2 lines:

`server=1`  
`blockfilterindex=1`

Then save, close, and reopen Bitcoin Core for the changes to apply.

#### Remote nodes
You'll also need a way to authenticate a connection to your node.
If this node is run on a different computer (a "remote" machine), you'll need to know the `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` that your bitcoin core node is using.
We recommend setting `rpcuser` to `specter` (if you can) for simplicity.

#### HWI Bridge
Note that for physically connecting hardware wallets using your laptop/desktop with Specter packaged on another device e.g. myNode, RaspiBlitz or Nodl, you may need to set up [HWI Bridge](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/docs/hwibridge.md). 

#### Optional Configuration
If you can tweak your settings, we recommend the following (optional):
* Do **not** run your node in [pruning mode](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#reduce-storage) as this disables `rescan` functionality.
In some edge cases you may need to rescan your node, and a pruned node will instead have to (automatically) `reindex` the whole blockchain (can take many hours to many days).
* If you have set [`blockfilterindex=1`](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.19.0.1), as suggested above, it takes just a few GB of storage and helps speedup blockchain `rescan`ing.
