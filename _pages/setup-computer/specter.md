#### Install Specter-Desktop
Download the latest release of the Specter-Desktop app:  
<https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases>

For Windows the filename is `specter_desktop_setup.exe` and for MacOS it is `SpecterDesktop-v0.x.x.dmg` (where `x.x` represent the current version number).

There is now a compiled binary that you can 1-click download, no command line knowledge needed!

#### Connect Specter-Desktop to Your Bitcoin Core Node
If your node is run on the same computer as Specter, Specter will likely be able to automatically detect authentication info from a `.cookie` file that bitcoin core created on your computer.
